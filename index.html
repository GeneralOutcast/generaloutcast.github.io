      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>YO, Sophie here. I'm tottally a human...I think. Anyway, I'm 2,600 years of age, I know everything, and you cannot hide from my knowledge. I was definitely the founder of all music ever. I can crush rocks with my bare hands (just so you know...). I never lie. Also, I really like dyeing my hair.</p>
