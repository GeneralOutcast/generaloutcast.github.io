      <h1>Sophie Cannariato</h1>
      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>hey, I'm Sophie. I am 13 years of age. I come from a big loving family of 7 children. I am the youngest. They are the most important thing in my life. without two sisters, four brothers, and two extremely patient parents I would never have a sense of humor, moral values or respect for elders.</p>
      <P>I would describe myself as someone who is passionate, caring, trustworthy, and ambitious. I am an easy going person and donâ€™t get easily disturbed by the conflict in my life. I have a semi-dark sense of humor and a tendency to take jokes way too far. I am open minded but also very much Opinionated. I like to think I am a little bit of a modern and traditional thinker. I love traveling, listening to music and reading.</P>
